// TO DO list

Next Steps:

- Create express server.
- Create database, create authentication with git hub.


//I should not over think database at this point. I need user authentication and a table of todos.
I can start with authentication and then move further.


I will create simplified verison first. We can register by adding a user and password. No need for
email or OUTH.

1. Create register form.
2. Add "post" request that will add new users to our database.
3. Create a log in form.
4. Add passport to check user login and password.
5. Show user object on page after log in.
